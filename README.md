This repo is for the details of the self balancing robot created from scratch.
This repo uses MPU6050 as the IMU(Intertial Measurement Unit). Data from the MPU is read using the [i2cdevlib and MPU6050](https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib).
Both library are added to the libraryfiles diretory which can be copied to the Arduino library inorder to use it in the program.

This is the Instrumentation Course Project done by second year Electronics, Communication and Information Engineering Students from IOE,Pulchowk Campus.This Repo also contains the Case study documentation required for the same subject related to the Instrumentation based Industries. We did this case study at DDC, Balaju whose report is done at https://www.overleaf.com/project/62e159923e3b4074664e056a .
